# Password Rodeo

Password Rodeo is a small Java library used to create and validate passwords.

Creation and validation are controlled by criteria you specify: password length and the presence or absence of certain types of characters (upper-cases, digits, etc.)
You use the library to randomly generate passwords and/or validate passwords submitted by the end-user.

Documentation, including a tutorial and a full manual, is available on [the project website](https://password.rodeo/).
